[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] A basic principle of fluids
[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] If you have a low enough density
[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] ...buoyant forces will allow you to float upward in the surrounding fluid
[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] So naturally, we made floating water.
[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] And now you can float while you float!
[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] Give it a try!
