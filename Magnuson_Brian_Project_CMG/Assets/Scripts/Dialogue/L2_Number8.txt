[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] Subject No. 8 Research Notes
[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] No. 8 loved coming to the Water Labs
[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] I remember him smiling as he rode through the floating water columns
[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] And then one day, he couldn't escape one of the columns...
[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] And he drowned...
[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] So we changed the rules...
[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] And now No. 8 can no longer drown
